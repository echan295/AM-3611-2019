# Quick Introduction to Git/GitHub

This documentation will give you a brief introduction to Git and GitHub.

Git is a "version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files". Git is local to your computer.

GitHub is a "Git repository hosting service" with added features. GitHub stores your repository on "the cloud" rather than on your computer.

## Introduction to Git
Git comes pre-installed in most computers. However, if Git is not installed onto your computer, you can install it at https://git-scm.com/downloads. While installing Git from this website also gives you a nice graphical user interface, this tutorial will only use terminal to access Git.

After you have installed Git, you need to set up your Git environment. You only need to do this the first time you install Git on your computer.
```console
git config --global user.name "Eunice Chan"
git config --global user.email "echan295@uwo.ca"
```
